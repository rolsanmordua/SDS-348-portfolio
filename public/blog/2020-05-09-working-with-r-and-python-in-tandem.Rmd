# Tidying in R
After spending quite a bit of time tidying in R this semester, I prefer tidying in R but still prefer to do analysis more programatically. 
``` {R}
iris2 <- iris %>% select(Species) %>% pull()
```

# Interpreting in Python
Here I am using Python to do a basic demo of intepretation in Python
```{python}
counts = {}
for val in r.iris2:
  if val not in counts:
     counts[val] = 0 
  counts[val] += 1

print(counts)
```
