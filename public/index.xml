      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Introduction For Project 2: “Modeling, Testing, and Predicting”, I am continuing with my diversity research theme from Project 1: “Exploratory Data Analysis”. The dataset I selected from Kaggle has demographics for 25 Silicon Valley tech companies of various sizes (ranging from 100 professionals to 36,0000). The dataset has categorical variables like company (name), gender (male, female), and job category (e.g. professional, executive, service, etc). There is one numeric variable for the count of people by ethnicity and job category by gender but I plan to tidy the dataset.</description>

      <description>Data Set Attributions Both of my datasets were acquired from Kaggle.
My Fortune 500 Diversity dataset was acquired from: https://www.kaggle.com/fortune-inc/f500-diversity, uploaded by user Fortune
My general Fortune 500 dataset was acquired from: https://www.kaggle.com/vineetjaiswal/fortune500-2017, uploaded by user Vineet
 Introduction I chose two datasets from Kaggle on the Fortune 500 companies from 2017. One data set is generic information on the Fortune 500 with numerical and categorical variables such as Fortune 500 rank, company name, website, sector (as in industry), HQ location, CEO, revenues, profits, and other financial data.</description>
